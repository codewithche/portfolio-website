# Product Requirements Document

## Goal
Create a responsive portfolio website that demonstrates my full-stack & AI learning journey and showcases projects professionally.

A portfolio website solves this by providing a structured, easy-to-navigate showcase of my work and journey.

## 2. Target Users
- Hiring managers evaluating technical skills
- Fellow developers following CodeWithChe
- Myself — tracking learning progress

## 3. Key Features (MVP)
1. Hero section with intro & CTA  
2. About + skills timeline  
3. Projects grid
4. Project detail pages with learning notes  
5. Contact form (Netlify / EmailJS)  
6. Responsive design (PC-first)  
7. Deployment to GitHub Pages / Netlify  

## 4. Success Metrics
- Live site deployed
