# ROADMAP.md

## 1. Overview
This roadmap outlines a 4-week learning and development plan for the **Personal Portfolio Website** project — focused on building solid frontend foundations (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and then refining the design using Bootstrap.

## 2. Vision
Build a professional, responsive portfolio website that clearly presents my background, projects, and learning journey — first coded from scratch, then enhanced with a framework.

## 3. Objectives
- Strengthen understanding of semantic HTML and CSS layout (Flexbox + Grid).
- Learn to design responsive layouts manually before using frameworks.
- Add interactivity with vanilla JavaScript.
- Refine and polish UI using Bootstrap for professional consistency.

## 4. Plan

- Create main sections: Hero, About, Projects, Contact.
- Add placeholder content and navigation links.
- **Learning Focus:** Semantic HTML, linking CSS/JS, page structure.

### Week 2 — CSS Layout (Flexbox & Grid)
